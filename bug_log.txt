Right now, there is a link to logout in the base template, but we have a bug here and the logout route logic is not implemented.

### THINGS WE MIGHT WANT TO DO?

1. pull g.user verification into its own func?

####

### THINGS TO WATCH!?

 - unfollow button exists in two (?) places:
    1. current user following page
    2. followed user's detail page

- Follow button appears on user profile AND in "following" page AND in "followers"

###


####BUGS

Delete user breaks app

Header hero image displaying weird

###


models.py

app.py
-Fixed minor typo in docstring for signup()
-Modified /logout route to have logic around CSRF validation, and to actually log the user out

base.html
-Changed logout from GET to POST request by putting it in a CSRF form

start_following()
 - updated to include form validation logic

 detail.html
 - added csrf form field to follow button

logout()
 - changed abort(404) to show flashed message on form fail to match other routes

start_following(),stop_following()
refactored follow/unfollow buttons. These now live in separate templates and are
referenced where needed in corresponding forms.
