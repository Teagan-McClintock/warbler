Right now, there is a link to logout in the base template, but we have a bug here and the logout route logic is not implemented.

### THINGS WE MIGHT WANT TO DO?

1. pull g.user verification into its own func?

####

### THINGS TO WATCH!?

 - unfollow button exists in two (?) places:
    1. current user following page
    2. followed user's detail page

- Follow button appears on user profile AND in "following" page AND in "followers"

###


####BUGS

 """"
    header_image_url = db.Column(
        db.String(255),
        nullable=False,
        default=DEFAULT_HEADER_IMAGE_URL,
    )
    """

    header_image_url is missing from register form - intentional?

    bio and location are also missing.

    Resolved: Changed Cancel button on edit form from user_id to g.user.id
