Right now, there is a link to logout in the base template, but we have a bug here and the logout route logic is not implemented.



models.py



app.py
-Fixed minor typo in docstring for signup()
-Modified /logout route to have logic around CSRF validation, and to actually log the user out

base.html
-Changed logout from GET to POST request by putting it in a CSRF form
